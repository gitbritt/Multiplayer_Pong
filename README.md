# Multiplayer_Pong
This is a multiplayer version of the game from the 1970's.

Setup
-----
1.) go to www.sfml-dev.org and download the the latest 32 bit version. I am using Visual Studio for this project.
	To make things simple and easy, make a folder in C:\ called "SFML(32)" and put the files here. The project is 
	already configured to use this location. 
	
	
2.)	If you want to put the files in your own location, then you will need to follow these tutorials.
