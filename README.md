# Multiplayer_Pong
This project is a re-make of the original Pong game that was developed by Atari in 1972.

# Intro and how it works
This project was origianlly a project proposed for a school project for a computer networking course at Southern Adventist University.
The purpose of the project was to develop something using TCP or UDP protocol(Ours uses TCP).


Our idea was to re-creat pong but make it multiplayer between two computers.
How it works is that there is a Server and a client computer. Bothe computers brodcast their paddle location,
but only the server broadcasts the Ball.
